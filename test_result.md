- Interactive info windows with washroom details
- **Status**: Requires Google Maps API key to function

## Testing Protocol

### Backend Testing Guidelines
- Test all API endpoints for functionality
- Verify geospatial queries work correctly
- Check error handling and edge cases
- Validate data models and responses

### Frontend Testing Guidelines  
- Test location detection functionality
- Verify washroom list displays correctly
- Check search filters work as expected
- Test responsive design on different screen sizes
- Verify map integration (once API key is provided)

### Integration Testing
- Test complete user flow from location to washroom selection
- Verify API communication between frontend and backend
- Check error handling for location permission denied
- Test with different search radii and filters

## Incorporate User Feedback
- Always prioritize user requirements and preferences
- Implement requested features in order of importance
- Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous
- Test thoroughly before marking features complete

## Next Steps Required

### 🔑 Google Maps API Key Required
To enable full map functionality, you'll need to:

1. **Get a Google Maps API Key:**
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select existing one
   - Enable the Maps JavaScript API
   - Create credentials (API Key)
   - Restrict the API key to your domain for security

2. **Configure the API Key:**
   - Add your API key to `/app/backend/.env`
   - Replace `your_google_maps_api_key_here` with your actual key
   - Restart the backend service

3. **API Key Format in .env:**
   ```
   GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=AIzaSyC4...YourActualAPIKey...XYZ
   ```

Without the API key, the map will show a fallback message but all other functionality works perfectly.
